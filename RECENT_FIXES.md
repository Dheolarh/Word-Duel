# Recent Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed multiple UI and functionality issues with modals, toggles, and keyboard input.

---

## 1. ✅ Removed White Background from Win/Lose/Tie Modal

**File:** `src/client/components/EndGameModal.tsx`

### Changes:
- **Removed** the Modal wrapper component that had white background
- Created **transparent overlay** with no background
- Changed text colors to **white with strong shadows** for visibility
- Kept all game result images and functionality intact

### Result:
- Win/Lose/Tie modals now display transparently over the game board
- Only the images and text are visible (no white card)
- Text is clearly visible with dark shadows

---

## 2. ✅ Fixed Toggle Component with Styled-Components

**File:** `src/client/components/Toggle.tsx`

### Issues Fixed:
- Toggles weren't showing at all
- Previous Tailwind approach had rendering issues

### Changes:
- **Completely rewrote** using `styled-components` (now installed)
- Uses the exact Apple-style toggle design provided
- Proper checkbox input with label (accessible)
- **Added spacing** between toggles with `py-3` padding
- **Proper sizing** (50px x 25px) - not oversized
- **Black border** around toggle track
- **Green gradient** when ON, **gray gradient** when OFF
- Smooth **25px slide animation** for the white knob

### Toggle Features:
```typescript
- Width: 50px
- Height: 25px  
- Border: 1px solid black
- Border-radius: 50px (fully rounded)
- Off: Gray gradient (#b3b3b3 to #e6e6e6)
- On: Green gradient (#4cd964 to #5de24e)
- Knob: 23px white circle with shadow
- Animation: 0.3s smooth transition
```

### Result:
- Toggles now display properly in the music modal
- Each toggle has proper spacing (not joined together)
- Correct size and appearance
- Smooth animations when toggling
- Works with both Background Music and Sound Effects

## 3. ✅ Fixed Physical Keyboard Input After AI Turn

**File:** `src/client/pages/Game.tsx`

### Issue:
- After AI made a guess, physical keyboard stopped working
- Only virtual on-screen keyboard worked
- Event listener wasn't re-attaching after game state changes

### Fix:
- Added `gameState` to the useEffect dependency array for keyboard handler
- Now re-attaches keyboard listener whenever game state updates
- Properly cleans up and re-establishes event listeners

### Before:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // keyboard handler
}, [currentGuess, gameStatus, isPaused, isSubmittingGuess]);
// ❌ Missing gameState dependency
```

### After:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // keyboard handler  
}, [currentGuess, gameStatus, isPaused, isSubmittingGuess, gameState, currentPlayer.id]);
// ✅ Includes gameState and currentPlayer.id
```

### Result:
- Physical keyboard works consistently throughout entire game
- Works before and after AI turns
- No need to rely on virtual keyboard only

## 4. ✅ Changed Waiting Modal Text Color to Black

**File:** `src/client/components/WaitingModal.tsx`

### Changes:
- Changed text color from white to **black**
- Updated text shadows for better visibility with black text
- Spinner color changed to match

### Result:
- "Waiting for opponent..." text now displays in black
- Still has strong shadow for visibility against game background
- More visible in various lighting conditions

---

## 5. ✅ Removed Horizontal Scroll from Music Modal

**File:** `src/client/components/Modal.tsx`

### Changes:
- Added `overflow-x-hidden` to modal container
- Ensured toggles fit within modal width
- Proper max-width constraints

### Result:
- No horizontal scrolling in music settings modal
- All content fits properly within modal boundaries
- Clean, contained appearance
