- **Desktop**: Type with physical keyboard (A-Z, Delete, Backspace) - all keys play satisfying click sounds
- Enter your secret word that your opponent must guess to win
- Real-time word validation occurs automatically when word is complete:
  - Shows "validating word..." status in light green game font
  - Invalid words display "{word} doesn't appear in the dictionary" in red error text
  - Valid words show "‚úì Word validated" in green confirmation text
  - Network errors display retry-enabled error messages with proper styling

#### Step 3: Select Game Mode

#### Smart Keyboard Visual Feedback
The on-screen keyboard keys dynamically change color based on your previous guesses:
- **Green keys**: Letters confirmed in correct positions
- **Yellow keys**: Letters confirmed in word but wrong positions  
- **Gray keys**: Letters confirmed not in the word
- **White keys**: Letters not yet guessed
- This visual system helps you make strategic subsequent guesses and avoid repeating eliminated letters
