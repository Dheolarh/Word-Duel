# Static Dictionary Migration Summary

## Overview
Migrated the entire word validation and AI word-list system from external API calls to local JSON-backed dictionaries (`l4_letters_definations.json` and `l5_letters_definations.json`). The game no longer depends on any external services.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. `src/server/services/dictionaryApi.ts` (Complete Rewrite)
**Before:**
- Used `fetch()` calls to external APIs (`api.dictionaryapi.dev`, `freedictionaryapi.com`, `api.datamuse.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`)
- Implemented retry logic and fallback mechanisms for network failures
- Had functions `fetchWordsByLength`, `fetchComprehensiveWordList`, `fetchWordBatch`, `validateWithPrimaryAPI`, `validateWithFallbackAPI`

**After:**
- Imports the static JSON files (`l4Data`, `l5Data`) using ES modules
- Pre-processes them into uppercase-key maps (`L4_MAP`, `L5_MAP`) at module load for fast O(1) lookup
- `fetchComprehensiveWordList(length)` now returns `Object.keys(map)` — all words from JSON
- `validateWordWithDictionary(word)` now performs a simple map lookup (no retry logic, no network)
- `validateWordOffline(word)` uses the same map (kept for API compatibility)
- **New:** `getDefinition(word)` retrieves the definition string from the JSON for a given word (for end-game modal display)

### 2. `src/server/utils/aiOpponent.ts`
**Before:**
- `initializeWordLists()` did nothing at startup (lazy on-demand fetching during gameplay)
- `getWordList(wordLength)` checked fetch flags and called external API with complex fallback logic
- `generateRandomWordFromAPI()` and `getValidatedWordsFromAPI()` called external dictionary API for validation/filtering
- AI classes (`EasyAI`, `MediumAI`, `DifficultAI`) called `getValidatedWordsFromAPI()` in `makeGuess()` to check words against APIs

**After:**
- `initializeWordLists()` now eagerly loads all words from JSON at server start and caches them in `CACHED_FOUR_LETTER_WORDS` and `CACHED_FIVE_LETTER_WORDS`
- `getWordList(wordLength)` returns the cached list directly (or loads from JSON if not yet cached)
- Removed `generateRandomWordFromAPI()` and `getValidatedWordsFromAPI()` entirely
- Introduced `generateRandomWordFromJSONList()` that picks a random word from the cached list
- All AI classes now call `generateRandomWordFromJSONList()` for `selectWord()` and removed the external validation calls from `makeGuess()`
- AI guesses are now drawn directly from the JSON-backed word pool with no network round-trips

### 3. `src/server/index.ts`
**Before:**
- `/api/validate-word` and `/api/submit-guess` wrapped `validateWordWithDictionary()` in `try-catch` blocks and fell back to `validateWordOffline()` if network errors occurred

**After:**
- Removed `try-catch` network error handling
- Removed `validateWordOffline` import (no longer needed since `validateWordWithDictionary` is synchronous map lookup wrapped in async)
- Validation now returns immediately from JSON map with no possibility of network errors

### 4. `devvit.json`
**Before:**
```json
"permissions": {
  "redis": true,
  "http": {
    "domains": [
      "api.dictionaryapi.dev",
      "freedictionaryapi.com",
      "api.wordnik.com",
      "api.merriam-webster.com",
      "api.datamuse.com",
      "raw.githubusercontent.com"
    ]
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
"permissions": {
  "redis": true
}
```
- Removed all external HTTP domain permissions (no longer needed)

## Benefits

1. **No Network Dependency**: Game runs fully offline; no external API failures, rate limits, or latency issues
2. **Faster Validation**: Word validation is now O(1) map lookup instead of network round-trip
3. **Reliable AI**: AI word selection is deterministic and instant (no waiting for API responses)
4. **Definitions Included**: The JSON files include definition strings which can be displayed in the end-game modal
5. **Simpler Code**: Removed complex retry logic, fallback mechanisms, and network error handling

---

## How It Works Now

1. **Player Word Validation (Pregame & In-Game)**:
   - User submits word → server calls `validateWordWithDictionary(word)` → looks up `word.toUpperCase()` in `L4_MAP` or `L5_MAP` → returns `{ isValid: true/false }`
   - If invalid, word is rejected immediately with error message

2. **AI Word Selection**:
   - Server calls `aiOpponent.ts` → `initializeWordLists()` loads all words from JSON at startup
   - AI calls `getWordList(wordLength)` → returns cached array of all 4- or 5-letter words
   - AI filters by feedback (green/yellow/red) and picks a random word from the filtered list
   - No external validation needed (all words in JSON are valid by definition)

3. **End-Game Modal**:
   - Server can call `getDefinition(word)` to retrieve the definition string for the opponent's secret word
   - Client displays the word + definition in the end-game modal

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Pregame validation**: Try entering invalid 4-letter and 5-letter words (should be rejected)
- [ ] **Pregame validation**: Try entering valid words from the JSON (should be accepted)
- [ ] **In-game guessing**: Submit valid guesses (should accept)
- [ ] **In-game guessing**: Submit invalid guesses (should reject with error)
- [ ] **AI secret word generation**: Start a game on Easy/Medium/Difficult — AI should have a valid secret word
- [ ] **AI guessing behavior**: Play a few rounds — AI should make guesses without delay or errors
- [ ] **AI word diversity**: Play multiple games — AI should not repeat words excessively
- [ ] **End-game modal**: Finish a game — opponent's word should be revealed (with definition if implemented in client)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **End-Game Definition Display**: Update the client `EndGameModal` to fetch and display the definition using `getDefinition(opponentWord)` from the server
2. **Extended Word Pool**: If needed, add more words to `l4_letters_definations.json` and `l5_letters_definations.json` (currently thousands of words each)
3. **AI Tuning**: Adjust AI difficulty filtering or scoring algorithms now that all words are instantly available
4. **Word Caching Optimization**: If memory is a concern, implement lazy-loading per word length (currently all words load at startup)

---

## Notes

- JSON files are located at:
  - `src/server/services/l4_letters_definations.json` (4-letter words)
  - `src/server/services/l5_letters_definations.json` (5-letter words)
- Format: `{ "word": "definition string" }`
- The JSON is imported as an ES module and TypeScript resolves it with `resolveJsonModule: true` in `tsconfig-base.json`
- No code changes are needed on the client side (validation/guessing APIs remain the same)
